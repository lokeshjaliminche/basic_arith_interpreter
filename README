How to Run:
==========
1. unzip HW1_LNJ.zip /*extract the zip file*/
2. cd HW1_LNJ
3. make
4. ./arith



Instrictions run tests:
======================
1. mytest.bat file is present in the "./HW1_LNJ/tests"
folder. Copy this file in the tests folder of test harness.
Run following command.

sh test.sh

Program Description :
====================
This programs contains Implemention of ARITH in C++

As per the requirement, this program does the following things:

- gets inputs via stdin and output via stdout
- parses the input into tokens and evaluates the expression 
- Currently it supports
	- multiplication, division, addition, subtraction.
	- unary operators (-(int))
	- All operations are supported for integers.

Grammar
The grammar in the homework is

<expr> ::== <int>
           |<expr> + <expr>
           |<expr> * <expr>

to capture the order of predence, my grammar is
Grammer:
=======
 <Primary> :: = NUMBER | - primary | (expression)

 <expression> :: = term + expression | term - expression | term

 <term> :: = <primary> / <term> | <primary> * <term> | <primary>
